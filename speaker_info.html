    <h1>Speaker Information</h1>

    <p>
      First, thanks for agreeing to speak. It helps a lot to have great talks and interesting speakers. We appreciate the time and effort that you have put into your talks.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact Information</h2>

    <p>
      My (Gray) phone number is 703 727-1307. Please email us yours, in case of last minute issues to "info@devignition.com".
    </p>

    <h2>Register and Check-In</h2>

    <p>
      Please register for the conference, if you haven't done so. It helps us to have a complete list.
      Registering as a regular Attendee is OK, since there is no charge for those tickets.
      If that changes, you can use the code <strong>di2024vip</strong> to register for free.
      If we remove that ticket option, we will put a code here for you to use. You do not have to buy a ticket, of course.
    </p>

    </p>
    
    <p>
      Please check in with the registration desk when you arrive and tell them you are a speaker, so we know you are at the venue. 
      And say hello to all of the organizers, especially if we have not actually met you in person before! We want to meet you.
    </p>

    <h2>Schedule</h2>

    <!--
    <p>
      We will publish a schedule very soon. We will email you with that link first to give you a couple of days to review it
      before we make it public.
    </p>
    -->

    <p>
      Please try to keep your talk to its scheduled length, and please start at your scheduled time. 
      This will give some time for the following speaker to set up, and not go into the break times.
    </p>

    <p>
      The schedule is below. The schedule is still subject to change, of course, depending upon feedback.
      A couple of speakers had specific requests. I tried to get all of those in, but if not, please let me know and I can try to fix it.
    </p>

    <h2>Video Adapters</h2>

    <p>
      Please bring your HDMI video adapter (your laptop to HDMI). The venue uses HDMI. They have new projectors. 
      I have an adapter from USB-C to HDMI,
      but adapters sometimes get lost 
      and we are left looking for one at the last minute. Please bring yours.
    </p>

    <h2>Try the Projection</h2>

    <p>
      Please try your presentation as soon as you can after you get there, either in the morning or a break. 
      Make sure you have the mirroring, resolution, etc. set up the way you want before your talk. 
      It is much better to have those issues solved before your talk begins!
      There will be power at the podium.
      The venue will be open to us starting at 7 AM. We will definately be there by 8 AM.
    </p>

    <h2>Wireless Internet Access</h2>

    <p>
      Wireless will be available, but as always it might not work! 
      Please do not depend upon it. 
      Have a version of your presentation on your laptop, if possible. 
      You will need to get a wireless account to use while there. They have instructions posted in the venue on how to do that. It is very easy.
    </p>

    <p>
      The projection is best at 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratio, but 16:9 will look better.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please avoid small text on your slides.
    </p>

    <h2>Speaker T-Shirts</h2>

    <p>
      Let us know your t-shirt sizes so we can save you a shirt.

    <h2>Location, Getting There, Parking, etc.</h2>

    <p>
      We are at GMU's Arlington VA Van Metre Hall, rooms 125 and 126 (the large ballroom, on the left side of the building as seen from the street). 
      Parking is possible under the building. 
      You have to go around the back of the building into the alley to get in there, though. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, the Virginia Square and Clarendon metro stops are just a couple of blocks from GMU, a 5 minute walk away (Orange and Silver DC Metro lines).

    <h2>Speakers Dinner</h2>

    <p>
      We will probably have a speakers dinner the night before Frontrunners. We will keep you posted about that.
    </p>
    -->

    <h2>Backup Talks</h2>
    <p>
      If you have a second talk, and are willing to give that as a backup, in case one of the other speakers cannot give their talk, we would appreciate it.
      We will send out a call for that, in the unlikely event that we need one.
    </p>

    <!--
    <h2>Lunch</h2>

    <p>
      The conference does not provide lunch. There are so many lunch places nearby that when we have done that in the past, everyone goes out anyway! 
      But we want to pay for speaker lunches. Please get a $20 bill from the registration desk or any of the organizers for that before you go out 
      (or more if you need it, especially if you can give us a receipt).
    </p>
    -->

    <h2>Social Media</h2>

    <p>
      Please tell everyone about us on social medai! 
      On X, we are <a href="https://twitter.com/devignition" target="_blank">twitter.com/devignition</a>), so please follow us.
    </p>

    <h2>Did I Forget Something?</h2>

    <p>
      Probably. If I have, I will send another email. If you have questions, let us know.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thanks again for speaking!
