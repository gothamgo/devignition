        I won't deny that Kubernetes is very complex, but at it's core… it's just a huge machine that converges to whatever state you tell it to converge to. A great first step in learning about Kubernetes is learning how applications run on it – or, to put it another way: learning how to tell Kubernetes the state you wish your application's resources to converge to.

        This talk will give an overview of Deployments, ReplicaSets, StatefulSets, Pods, Services, and LoadBalancers – i.e.: the "nouns" ("Manifests" in Kubernetes lingo) you use when describing your application to Kubernetes.

        Codebases are living, breathing things. Writing supple software is essential to their health and longevity. Inspired by Bethesda Games Studio's methodology in developing the acclaimed video game, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, this talk dives into how to set yourself, your team, your organization and (optionally) external contributors up for success when maintaining software.

        This adventurous talk will dive into the intricacies of domain-driven design, library structures and experiences in the battlefield (remember, we're in a dangerous fantasy land) of multi-language codebases with over 180,000 lines of code. It will touch on the separation between deployment and development strategy, how that interplays with artifact production and service design, and how you can make everyone more productive in your codebase.

        How should we handle feature branches? Can we perform large refactors? How do we make handling tech debt easier or reducing it altogether? Can we onboard new people into this codebase? Can we introduce new technologies or phase out old ones? This talk aims to tackle all of these questions and more.

        <p><a href="{{site.url}}/speakers.html#amanvir_parhar">Amanvir Parhar</a></p>
        Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have revolutionized the way we interact with AI, but, as developers, harnessing their power for practical applications can be challenging.

        LLMs generate text in formats that are arbitrary and unpredictable, and simply modifying the prompt to ask the model to respond in a specific format does not guarantee that the resulting output will match the schema you provided.

        However, structured outputs offer a way to get data from an LLM in a deterministic manner. This one amazing feature, which OpenAI introduced to its GPT models this summer, opens up a plethora of possibilities for devs.

        In this talk, I'll cover the basics of how structured outputs work and showcase several innovative demos that use structured outputs to leverage LLMs in unique ways.
